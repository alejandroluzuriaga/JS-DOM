//There are two ways of working with timers. timeOut and Intervals.. In this file we'll see the second one: setInterval().
//setInterval(we specify how often do we want to execute a block of code (in miliseconds))
// Their functions are called 'callbacks' too.
// Its possible to delete an Interval with clearInterval() function.

// setInterval(function, 500) //Two parameters. Function to execute, and time in miliseconds to launch the function again in loop.

                            // To learn about Intervals we'll be programming a little game similar to Whac-a-mole (hit the moles to win points)
